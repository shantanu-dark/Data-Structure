1. Write a program which will read temperature value in Fahrenheit scale and print the value in Celsius scale.

Code: 

import java.util.Scanner;
public class FahrtoCel {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter temperature in Fahrenheit: ");
        double fahrenheit = input.nextDouble();

        double celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5.0 / 9.0;

        System.out.println(fahrenheit + "°F is equal to " + celsius + "°C");
    }
}


2. Write a program to enter length and width of a rectangle and find area and perimeter of the rectangle.

Code:

import java.util.Scanner;
public class RectangleAreaPerimeter {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the length of the rectangle: ");
        double length = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the width of the rectangle: ");
        double width = input.nextDouble();

        double area = length * width;
        double perimeter = 2 * (length + width);

        System.out.println("Area of the rectangle: " + area);
        System.out.println("Perimeter of the rectangle: " + perimeter);
    }
}


3. Write a program to enter marks of five subjects of a student and calculate total, average and percentage of all subjects.

Code: 

import java.util.Scanner;
public class StudentMarks {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        int totalMarks = 0;
        double averageMarks = 0.0;
        double percentage = 0.0;

        
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.print("Enter marks for subject " + i + ": ");
            int marks = input.nextInt();
            totalMarks += marks;
        }

        
        averageMarks = (double) totalMarks / 5;
        percentage = (averageMarks / 100) * 100;

       
        System.out.println("Total marks: " + totalMarks);
        System.out.println("Average marks: " + averageMarks);
        System.out.println("Percentage: " + percentage + "%");
    }
}


4. Write four statements by using printf function to print an asterisk pattern having 1, 3,5 and 7 asterisks (*) in successive lines so that it generates a triangular pattern as given below.


*
* * *
* * * * *
* * * * * * *


Code:

System.out.printf("%s\n", "*");
System.out.printf("%3s\n", "*");
System.out.printf("%5s\n", "*");
System.out.printf("%7s\n", "*");


5. A ball is released from a height of Y meters. Each time it bounces on the floor, its velocity becomes halved. Write a program, which reads the value of Y and prints the total
distance traversed by the ball when it touches the ground for the third time. Assume that the value of acceleration due to gravity, g, is 9.8.


Code:


import java.util.Scanner;
public class BouncingBall {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

       System.out.print("Enter the initial height (Y meters): ");
       double initialHeight = input.nextDouble();

       double gravity = 9.8;  

       double totalDistance = 0;
       double currentHeight = initialHeight;

       for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
           double bounceHeight = currentHeight / 2;

           totalDistance += currentHeight + bounceHeight;

           currentHeight = bounceHeight;
       }

       System.out.println("Total distance traversed: " + totalDistance + " meters");
   }
}



6. Consider a bank that offers fixed deposit accounts with cumulative (annually) interest on the balance available in the account. Write a C program that reads the amount initially invested (called
Principal amount) in an account and interest rate. The program generates the balance available in the account at the end of each year for first five years.


Code:

import java.util.Scanner;
public class FixedDeposit {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

       int YEARS = 5; 

       System.out.print("Enter principal amount: ");
       double principalAmount = input.nextDouble();

       System.out.print("Enter interest rate (in percentage): ");
       double interestRate = input.nextDouble();
       interestRate /= 100; 

       System.out.println("\nYear-end balances:");
       for (int year = 1; year <= YEARS; year++) {
           double interestEarned = principalAmount * interestRate;
           principalAmount += interestEarned;
           System.out.printf("Year %d: Balance = $%.2f\n", year, principalAmount);
       }
   }
}
